# DTP SlotEase

## Project Overview
DTP SlotEase is a centralized digital platform designed to streamline slot booking and UPI-based payments across multiple DTP (Desktop Publishing) sections in a university campus.

The system enables students to view real-time availability of DTP slots across different locations, book preferred slots in advance, and make cashless payments, ensuring a hassle-free printing experience.
